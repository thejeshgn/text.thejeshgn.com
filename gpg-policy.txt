GnuPG Signature Policy
======================
The following paragraphs describe the procedure, preconditions 
and possible results of me signing data or keys.

 Data or Email Signing
 ============

Only some emails from my UID are signed. But if you really want
to be sure that the mail/note is from me then it has to be signed by me.

 Key Signing
 ===========

 For signing keys, I use the same key as for signing data. To ensure the
 validity of the web of trust, I stick strictly to the following points:

   * In most cases, personal validation is required to obtain a signature from
     me. Personal validation means that a government issued document containing the
     full name and a photo must be presented to me at an eye-to-eye meeting.
   * Fingerprints and UIDs of the key(s) to be signed must be provided in a re-
     liable and readable way. During personal validation, a printed version of
     all UIDs and the key fingerprint should be provided.
   * In rare cases, I also sign keys without personal validation. This is only possible if 
     I know you for a long time and I am really really sure that the key belongs to you.
   * In rare cases, names can be signed that cannot be verified with any document.
     This is the case for well-known nicknames in the FOSS community.
   * A sig3 is only issued to keys of people whom I ultimately trust on a human
     basis, this is limited to close friends and people that have proven reliabi-
     lity and knowledge of the web of trust in other areas (like, but not limited
     to, CAcert, etc.).
   * In order to obtain a sig3, basic knowledge of these terms should be shown.
